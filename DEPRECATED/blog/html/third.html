        <p>Here’s another entry!</p>
        <h2 id="aidanmellin.github.io">//aidanmellin.github.io//</h2>
        <p>My biggest thing that I figured out how to do was making it
        such that I can have my splash (home) page be in the center of
        the screen, but still be the first thing viewed when one visits
        the page.</p>
        <p>This was done through an onLoad() with an anchor, which was
        easy enough, but the hardest part was keeping with my
        “continuous” flow design, where everything is in a grid. It’s
        hard to describe so I’ll try and make a diagram</p>
        <p>Initially the setup was as follows<br />
        ______________________ ______________________<br />
        |___ HOME PAGE________ | ______ BLOG PAGE ___ |<br />
        |__ ABOUT PAGE________ | ____________________ |</p>
        <p>But I wanted to add a Projects page to the left of the splash
        page that contains all of my major git Projects. This was
        difficult because the initial setup used base
        <strong>vw</strong> and <strong>vh</strong> to define where the
        page divisions would be. I had to effectively completely redo
        that. With that, I expanded the total width of the page to
        300vw, and had to pad a div such that my about could be in the
        same spot.</p>
        <p>Now, the setup is as such<br />
        _____________________ ______________________
        ______________________<br />
        |______ PROJECTS______|_____ HOME PAGE______ | _____ BLOG
        PAGE______ |<br />
        |_____ BLANK DIV______|______ ABOUT PAGE____ | _____
        UNUSED_________ |</p>
        <p>That blank div is there because its all counting. I have to
        give somewhat concrete references as to how the page will be
        layout, where from Left to Right, Top to Bottom, the divs are
        effectively numbered 1-6.</p>
        <p>This then means that if I want to add an upper section, I
        will need to expand the <strong> vh </strong> 200, and then pad
        2 divs (numbers 1 and 3, or 0 and 2 depending on how you
        count)</p>
        <h2 id="swift-web-checkers">//SWIFT &amp; Web Checkers//</h2>
        <p>This is a new section that I will be adding to as I go. This
        is an aspect of my SWEN-261 class that has me working with 4
        other people to make a team to develop a web application with.
        While there is programming in this, it has been emphasized that
        the primary focus is that of SWIFT and Agile Programming / Team
        work, to the point where I have heard that someone had a
        nonfunctioning project that received a 90% as a grade. I don’t
        really know how I feel about this class. I understand these
        concepts of teamwork are important, however the rigidity is not
        something that I have ever seen truly demonstrated in a
        workspace. This feeling, however, is biased due to my hatred of
        academics in general, specifically college, such as the rigidity
        found in Computer Science classes – which is the literal
        antithesis of the concept. Yes there are rules to follow, but
        having strict rules as to HOW you are to reach a goal defeats
        the purpose of the theory and programming of anything.</p>
        <p>(I’m done ranting / getting political)</p>

        <p>Obviously I need to add to my projects page. Some other
        things include - Populating About Me - Adding Resume with quick
        download &lt;– Maybe a web view with a quick download? - Make
        hover effects for the blog buttons - Work on School Projects -
        Play more Ultimate Frisbee (Sectionals in a month!)</p>
