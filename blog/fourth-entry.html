    <h1>Fourth Entry - 10/21/21</h1>

    <h2>//General Updates//</h2>
    <p> The past little bit has been okay! I've been primarily focusing on my academic projects, and obviously the requisite mental breakdowns</p>
    <p>My Ultimate Frisbee team and I managed to make it through sectionals and on to regionals! Regionals are set to take place at the beginning of November (the first weekend I believe). It's gonna be a lot of fun, I can feel it</p>
    <p>What else is new? I'm still going to the gym albeit less, still reading books in my downtime (which is sparse nowadays), and RIT is deliberating on the pass/fail option for classes this year. Other than that I've basically been putting my nose to my figurative book and working on classes.</p>

    <h2>//Artificial Intelligence Project//</h2>
    <p>I have an AI project due next Wednesday, whose subject revolves around First Order Language resolution -- essentially take a Knowledge Base and determine if a user inputted entry can be considered true with the given knowledge.</p>
    <p>It's obviously a rough time, but I'm having fun as this class itself is fun and because I get to utilize classes and object oriented design through Python (which is a tad bit more unwieldly, but I digress). I'm looking forward to finishing that this weekend</p>

    <h2>//aidanmellin.github.io//</h2>
    <p>I admittedly haven't done much with this website in a little bit as my mind has been scattered. I finally got around to publishing the about me page of the site. I am also writing this fourth devlog post right now</p>
    <p>Some things that are on the future TODO list include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hover effect for blog buttons</li>
        <li>Sprucing up the page a bit more</li>
        <li>Figure out other cool things to integrate with this website!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>//Next Steps//</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Continue working on school [projects, homework, etc]</li>
        <li>Keep programming and researching topics that are interesting to me</li>
        <li>Don't lose my mind (this one is gonna be hard)</li>
        <li>I'd like to be more active, so I am going to force myself to go to the gym more and play more sports whenever I can</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-align: center;">Peace out!</p>
    <p>.</p>
