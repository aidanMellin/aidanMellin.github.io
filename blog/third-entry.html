    <h1>Third Entry - 9/13/21</h1>
    Here's another entry!
    <h2>//aidanmellin.github.io//</h2>
    <p>My biggest thing that I figured out how to do was making it such that I can have my splash (home) page be in the
        center of the screen, but still be the first thing viewed when one visits the page. </p>
    <p>This was done through an onLoad() with an anchor, which was easy enough, but the hardest part was keeping with my
        "continuous" flow design, where everything is in a grid. It's hard to describe so I'll try and make a diagram
    </p>
    <p>Initially the setup was as follows</p>
    <p>_____________________ _____________________</p>
    <p>|___HOME PAGE________|______BLOG PAGE_____|</p>
    <p>|__ABOUT PAGE________|____________________|</p>
    <p>
        But I wanted to add a Projects page to the left of the splash page that contains all of my major git Projects.
        This was difficult because the initial setup used base <strong>vw</strong> and <strong>vh</strong> to define
        where the page divisions would be. I had to effectively completely redo that. With that, I expanded the total
        width of the page to 300vw, and had to pad a div such that my about could be in the same spot.
    </p>
    <p>Now, the setup is as such</p>
    <p>_____________________ ____________________ _____________________</p>
    <p>|______PROJECTS______|_____HOME PAGE______|_____BLOG PAGE______|</p>
    <p>|_____BLANK DIV______|______ABOUT PAGE____|_____UNUSED_________|</p>
    <p>That blank div is there because its all counting. I have to give somewhat concrete references as to how the page will be layout, where from Left to Right, Top to Bottom, the divs are effectively numbered 1-6.</p>
    <p>This then means that if I want to add an upper section, I will need to expand the <strong> vh </strong> 200, and then pad 2 divs (numbers 1 and 3, or 0 and 2 depending on how you count)</p>Ã¥

    <h2>//Next Steps//</h2>
    <p>Obviously I need to add to my projects page.</p>
    <p>Some other things include</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Populating About Me</li>
        <li>Adding Resume with quick download <-- Maybe a web view with a quick download?</li>
        <li>Make hover effects for the blog buttons</li>
        <li>Work on School Projects</li>
        <li>Play more Ultimate Frisbee (Sectionals in a month!)</li>
    </ul>
