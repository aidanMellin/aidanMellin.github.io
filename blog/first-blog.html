        <h1>First Entry!</h1>
        <p>
            So this is my first real addition to the blog for my website. I don't really know what quite to talk about,
            so I'll talk a bit about what I'm doing for my website, and the other projects that I'm walking on.
        </p>
        <h2>//aidanmellin.github.io//</h2>
        <p>
            Today was really working on starting to form the site. I had some help from stack overflow that has to do
            with how the home page is set up (that is to say how the Splash, About Me, and base-blog pages are all one
            continuous file instead of links to navigate to).
            Obviously I'm also contributing to the blog sections, with which I am going to use this post as a way of
            beginning to frame actual blog posts, especially such that they are dynamically placed in a readable format.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would also like to start populating my About Me page and having a link to my Resumé, so that I can have a
            working site that I can then add to my Resume.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am now realizing that I am also going to want to have a Github Projects page that updates every so often,
            which would be JS that pulls an update when the page is loaded. Off the top of my head this would be done
            with either a Pseudo-RSS feed or through the Github API which is probably best, just a pain to parse.
        </p>
        <h2>//A* Algorithms//</h2>
        <p>
            I have an assigned Lab for my Artificial Intelligence class that so far seems pretty good (even though I'm
            using image processing through Python). This isn't much to call home about considering everyone else taking
            this course @ RIT is also completing this task.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead I'm planning on furthering the use of A*. I currently have an Excel sheet that has all assignments
            loaded onto it (currently by hand, but that automation comes later). I have encountered issues with
            prioritization of work (mostly around my schedule but also the order in which I attack the work). Using an
            A* path algorithm would allow me to change prioritize events based on assignment type and generate a
            heuristic that also takes days until due into account. [<-- initially this will assume full completion of
                tasks, but i might also include half-measures eventually] </p>
