# We're Back!
  
So it's been a while since I've really done anything with this website because I was pretty happy with where it was at and I had a lot of other things to worry about.

## Let's Recap
  
Some key points that happened:
    - I had an internship! From January to August I worked at a company called Eagleview and was essentially a full-stack developer with our government contracts, dealing with aerial imagery.
    - I'm back in school finishing up my Computer Science BS. I had a number of classes in the Fall of 22 and now 18 credits and 19 hours of work a week at ITS (fixing computers and whatnot)
    - Also refactoring the website! (More on this momentarily)
  
## Refactoring the Website
  
  - Have already started with finally fixing the tables for my Github Project. I already had the JS Function returning a big formatted string, so I just had to learn some more about how to append to the document.  
  (hint: it was document.getElementById("githubTable").innerHTML = formattedString;) <-- Also probably using this for future reference  
  
  - Currently revamping my devlog/blog section. (While watching the Good Place on Netflix) I am now using Markdown to make the initial notes and then convert them into HTML with PANDOC and a quick shell script.  
  
  - ~~Next plan is two prongs of the same fork: I want to use JS to automatically loop through a given directory to either add these blog entries automatically if they exist in the blog/html directory, and potentially make it so that I can do so with my icons to just condense my overall code.~~
  So change in plans. I can add all of the titles of the devlogs to an array and append a series of html links to a string, much what I did with the Github Table, but I don't think that is the play either.

## Next Steps
  
I'm also concurrently starting a project as an extension of Frank Liang's Word Hy-phen-ation (I'll make a devlog on this). It's a pretty big project so I don't know how long it's going to take, but this is something that I've wanted to do since 2020, so I'm hopeful. I've been sick for the last week or so, so I've gotten a lot of research done already, and I just need to formulate my thoughts.

Side note I'm really loving the Good Place. Would recommend.
