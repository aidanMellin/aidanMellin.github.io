# Fourth Entry - 10/21/21

## //General Updates//
The past little bit has been okay! I've been primarily focusing on my academic projects, and obviously the requisite mental breakdowns  
  
My Ultimate Frisbee team and I managed to make it through sectionals and on to regionals! Regionals are set to take place at the beginning of November (the first weekend I believe). It's gonna be a lot of fun, I can feel it  
  
What else is new? I'm still going to the gym albeit less, still reading books in my downtime (which is sparse nowadays), and RIT is deliberating on the pass/fail option for classes this year. Other than that I've basically been putting my nose to my figurative book and working on classes.  
  
## //Artificial Intelligence Project//
I have an AI project due next Wednesday, whose subject revolves around First Order Language resolution -- essentially take a Knowledge Base and determine if a user inputted entry can be considered true with the given knowledge.  
  
It's obviously a rough time, but I'm having fun as this class itself is fun and because I get to utilize classes and object oriented design through Python (which is a tad bit more unwieldly, but I digress). I'm looking forward to finishing that this weekend  
  
## //aidanmellin.github.io//
I admittedly haven't done much with this website in a little bit as my mind has been scattered. I finally got around to publishing the about me page of the site. I am also writing this fourth devlog post right now  
  
Some things that are on the future TODO list include:
    - Hover effect for blog buttons
    - Sprucing up the page a bit more
    - Figure out other cool things to integrate with this website!
  
## //Next Steps//
    - Continue working on school [projects, homework, etc]
    - Keep programming and researching topics that are interesting to me
    - Don't lose my mind (this one is gonna be hard)
    - I'd like to be more active, so I am going to force myself to go to the gym more and play more sports whenever I can
  
Peace Out!
