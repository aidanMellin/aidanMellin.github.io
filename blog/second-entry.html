    <h1>Second Entry</h1>
    <h2>//aidanmellin.github.io//</h2>
    <p> This is the second addendum to the blog/devlog section of my website. The primary purpose of this specific post
        is to give myself multiple blog posts to start to determine how to setup / manipulate.
    </p>
    <p> Secondly, I will ideally be posting a blog to this once a week unless I have a rather full week of working /
        programming.
    </p>

    <h3>Some other TODOs for today:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> -Add Reslab Icon (My work for ITS with programming)
        </li>
        <li> -Set up blog such that it can be easily added to in the future (dynamic)
        </li>
        <li> -Start to populate my About Me page. I have what I wrote in my last website iteration, but I wan't
            something better.
        </li>
        <li> -Work on my homework. (Specifically my ASM lab and my A* Algorithm lab)
        </li>
    </ul>
