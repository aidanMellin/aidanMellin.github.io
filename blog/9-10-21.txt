This is the second addendum to the blog/devlog section of my website. The primary purpose of this specific post is to give myself multiple blog posts to start to determine how to setup / manipulate.

Secondly, I will ideally be posting a blog to this once a week unless I have a rather full week of working / programming.

Some other TODOs for today:
	-Add Reslab Icon (My work for ITS with programming)
	-Set up blog such that it can be easily added to in the future (dynamic)
	-Start to populate my About Me page. I have what I wrote in my last website iteration, but I wan't something better.
	-Work on my homework. (Specifically my ASM lab and my A* Algorithm lab)
