        <h1 id="were-back">We’re Back!</h1>
        <p>So it’s been a while since I’ve really done anything with
        this website because I was pretty happy with where it was at and
        I had a lot of other things to worry about.</p>
        <h2 id="lets-recap">Let’s Recap</h2>
        <p>Some key points that happened: - I had an internship! From
        January to August I worked at a company called Eagleview and was
        essentially a full-stack developer with our government
        contracts, dealing with aerial imagery. - I’m back in school
        finishing up my Computer Science BS. I had a number of classes
        in the Fall of 22 and now 18 credits and 19 hours of work a week
        at ITS (fixing computers and whatnot) - Also refactoring the
        website! (More on this momentarily)</p>

        <ul>
        <li><p>Have already started with finally fixing the tables for
        my Github Project. I already had the JS Function returning a big
        formatted string, so I just had to learn some more about how to
        append to the document.<br />
        (hint: it was document.getElementById(“githubTable”).innerHTML =
        formattedString;) &lt;– Also probably using this for future
        reference</p></li>
        <li><p>Currently revamping my devlog/blog section. (While
        watching the Good Place on Netflix) I am now using Markdown to
        make the initial notes and then convert them into HTML with
        PANDOC and a quick shell script.</p></li>
        <li><p>Next plan is two prongs of the same fork: I want to use
        JS to automatically loop through a given directory to either add
        these blog entries automatically if they exist in the blog/html
        directory, and potentially make it so that I can do so with my
        icons to just condense my overall code.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
        <p>I’m also concurrently starting a project as an extension of
        Frank Liang’s Word Hy-phen-ation (I’ll make a devlog on this).
        It’s a pretty big project so I don’t know how long it’s going to
        take, but this is something that I’ve wanted to do since 2020,
        so I’m hopeful. I’ve been sick for the last week or so, so I’ve
        gotten a lot of research done already, and I just need to
        formulate my thoughts.</p>
        <p>Side note I’m really loving the Good Place. Would
        recommend.</p>
        <p>.</p>
