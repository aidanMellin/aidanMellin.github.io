        <h2 id="general-updates">//General Updates//</h2>
        <p>The past little bit has been okay! I’ve been primarily
        focusing on my academic projects, and obviously the requisite
        mental breakdowns</p>
        <p>My Ultimate Frisbee team and I managed to make it through
        sectionals and on to regionals! Regionals are set to take place
        at the beginning of November (the first weekend I believe). It’s
        gonna be a lot of fun, I can feel it</p>
        <p>What else is new? I’m still going to the gym albeit less,
        still reading books in my downtime (which is sparse nowadays),
        and RIT is deliberating on the pass/fail option for classes this
        year. Other than that I’ve basically been putting my nose to my
        figurative book and working on classes.</p>
        <h2 id="artificial-intelligence-project">//Artificial
        Intelligence Project//</h2>
        <p>I have an AI project due next Wednesday, whose subject
        revolves around First Order Language resolution – essentially
        take a Knowledge Base and determine if a user inputted entry can
        be considered true with the given knowledge.</p>
        <p>It’s obviously a rough time, but I’m having fun as this class
        itself is fun and because I get to utilize classes and object
        oriented design through Python (which is a tad bit more
        unwieldly, but I digress). I’m looking forward to finishing that
        this weekend</p>
        <h2 id="aidanmellin.github.io">//aidanmellin.github.io//</h2>
        <p>I admittedly haven’t done much with this website in a little
        bit as my mind has been scattered. I finally got around to
        publishing the about me page of the site. I am also writing this
        fourth devlog post right now</p>
        <p>Some things that are on the future TODO list include: - Hover
        effect for blog buttons - Sprucing up the page a bit more -
        Figure out other cool things to integrate with this website!</p>
        <h2 id="next-steps">//Next Steps//</h2>
        <pre><code>- Continue working on school [projects, homework, etc]
- Keep programming and researching topics that are interesting to me
- Don&#39;t lose my mind (this one is gonna be hard)
- I&#39;d like to be more active, so I am going to force myself to go to the gym more and play more sports whenever I can</code></pre>
        <p>Peace Out!</p>
