        <p>This is the second addendum to the blog/devlog section of my
        website. The primary purpose of this specific post is to give
        myself multiple blog posts to start to determine how to setup /
        manipulate.</p>
        <p>Secondly, I will ideally be posting a blog to this once a
        week unless I have a rather full week of working /
        programming.</p>
