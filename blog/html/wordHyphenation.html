    <p>Liang’s Thesis is <a href="https://www.tug.org/docs/liang/" target="_blank">here</a> by the way.</p>
    <h2 id="a-little-bit-more-about-my-new-personal-project">A
        little bit more about my new personal project</h2>
    <p>This one is kind of a biggie. I’m going to be using Frank
        Liang’s thesis from 1983 concerning the auto-generation of
        hyphens between words for the original TeX system for my own
        personal ideas. The simple translation is thus: the Liang Method
        of word hyphenation splits words on the syllables of words such
        that someone reading a passage doesn’t come into any
        interruptions that may occur when having to switch lines. To
        make this a little bit easier to understand, its the difference
        between reading:</p>
    <p>the longest side of a triangle is called the hypot-<br />
        enuse and can be solved with Pythagoras’ Theorem.</p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>The longest side of a triangle is called the hy-<br />
        potenuse and can be solved with Pythagoras’ Theorem.</p>
    <p>This is cool and all, but what good is it if it’s already
        been implemented some fifty years ago? Well the answer is
        twofold:<br />
        1. There’s no obvious examples of it being written in a HLL
        today that anyone can implement.<br />
        2. I want to use it to make poems.</p>
    <p>Okay I don’t really want to have it automatically make poems,
        but I want it to be able to read input and tell me if it follows
        some poem syllabic scheme. The most obvious form of poetry that
        will fit this bill is a haiku, but with a little tweaking it can
        also incorporate things like Limericks. My main purpose for
        doing this is as yet another incorporation into my Discord Bot.
        If you are unfamiliar with that project, the link is <a
            href="https://github.com/aidanMellin/discordBot" target="_blank">here</a>. There
        are a couple of these “bots” that float around online on Tumblr
        and Reddit, but as far as I can tell they just use a series of
        dictionaries to define various syllables and how they fit in
        words. This takes up a lot of space, and the lookups alone mean
        that someone probably has to manually call the bot in order to
        run the script so that there isn’t too much processing power
        used.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2 id="more-specifics.">More specifics.</h2>
    <p>The overall project can be broken down into two essential
        features: 1. The dictionary and storage of it 2. The method for
        selecting the hyphen locations Theres also a question of best
        place to place said hyphens discussed in the paper, but given
        that my idea is to simply use all of possible hyphen locations,
        this probably won’t be an issue. (Remember that this was for
        very specific instances of hyphenating a word such that there
        isn’t any “ghastly white space” using narrow columns)</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>
    <p>Liang introduced the idea of a packed trie, which is very
        similar to an indexed trie, except a lot more condensed. Let me
        explain.</p>
    <p>A trie (also known as a prefix tree) is similar to most other
        trees with a little twist. Basically it’s an elegant solution to
        determining if a word is in a given set. You search letter by
        letter until you get (usually a boolean) response of whether or
        not a word exists in the set (tree).</p>
    <p>A simple trie would look something like this:</p>
    <pre><code>        root    
       /    \  
      A      B  
      |     / \  
      P    A   I  
     / \   |   |  
    E   P  T   G  
        |  
        L  
        |  
        E  </code></pre>
    <p>It’s not too particularly hard to implement and it’s pretty
        easy to insert, delete, etc. It’s cool and all, but what if the
        lookup time complexity could be greatly reduced?</p>
    <p><em>Enter indexed tries:</em><br />
        Indexed tries use a large array to store pointers for each of
        the children contained in the array. You have to intialize a
        super large array (26<sup>2</sup>) to be precise. The issue with
        this is that not all of these spaces allocated in the array are
        actually going to be used. It’s a lot of wasted space. All of
        those null pointers and nulls don’t need to be there.</p>
    <p>So, <strong>Packed tries</strong>.<br />
        Packed tries are essentially indexed tries, but just… packed
        tighter. You loop through the trie initially created, and simply
        go level by level putting in pointers in a first fit method,
        where there is no overlap of the pointers themselves, or where
        they’re pointing to. But what do I mean by that? I probably
        won’t do Liang’s explanation justice, but essentially our packed
        trie is going to store two items per index in the array: the
        letter it corresponds to, and the pointer to the next related
        letter.<br />
        All letters are assigned their own index (think offset) such
        that if we wanted to find HAVE (the example provided in the
        thesis) we would first look for H with the provided offset (8),
        and see that in that index, there is both an H and 30.<br />
        We travel to 30, and know that the next letter we are looking
        for is an A, so we add one (the offset of A) to the index of 30,
        and find our A with a provided pointer to 29. (Alternatively if
        we wanted to find HE, we would go to 30, add 5, and in index 35
        there exists an E that can function as a terminal state).<br />
        We go to 29, and indexing by V gets us a 51, this points to
        2.<br />
        In location 7 (2 – given index plus 5 – offset of E), we find E
        that coincidentally points to 0, which means there are no
        possible children states.</p>
    <p>If none of this made sense, that’s fine. It took me a while.
        Just check out the actual thesis itself linked at the top of the
        page. Theres a nice visual to go along with it on page 16.</p>
    <p>That’s pretty much the gist of the storage of the dictionary.
        While mostly considered a nonissue nowadays with people having
        access to what is esentially unlimited storage, I wish to stay
        true to form and implement it in this way. That means next we
        talk about the:</p>

    <h3 id="selecting-hyphens.">Selecting Hyphens.</h3>
    <p>Admittedly I don’t completely understand how this section
        works as I would argue I haven’t fully grasped its topic yet,
        but I will definitely come back around and update this devlog
        with what I figure out. What I do know is that there is a lot of
        focus on using patterns and inhibiting patterns (instead of
        exceptions) for building the heuristic of the selecting
        hyphens.<br />
        The TeX system used a series of 5 passes of both inhibiting and
        regular patterns to build their dictionary, and achieved rather
        high accuracy (the goal of the project). I haven’t given much
        thought as to how to actually start it yet, but obviously that
        comes a little bit later.</p>
    <h2 id="side-notes">Side notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Obviously this will need testing in order to build it out,
            so I’m either going to have to find an available source for
            hyphens and words, or build my own. Getting a dictionary won’t
            be too hard, but finding a source with good hyphenations might
            be a little bit harder.</li>
        <li>I have to come back around and finish writing the selecting
            hyphens section, but that comes later and with
            understanding.</li>
        <li>I still have some ideas with what to do with the website, so
            I’m going to probably bounce between planning this project and
            doing simple tweaks to the website.</li>
        <li>I also know that no one is really reading this, but my
            simple act of writing how I understand this has allowed me to
            reinforce what I’ve learned and leave proof that I’m not going
            to flake on this project.</li>
        <li>Maybe I can use my word hyphenation to fix the weird white
            space on my devlogs??</li>
    </ul>
