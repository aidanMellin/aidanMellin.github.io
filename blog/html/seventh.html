        <p>I actually have work on Sundays, but I spent this morning
        doing some pretty chill QOL updates for the website</p>
        <h2 id="the-website">The Website</h2>
        <h3 id="project-page">Project Page</h3>
        <p>Most of what I did was more with the Javascript, and more
        specifically with the Github Repo table on the projects
        screen.</p>
        <p><strong>What it was</strong></p>
        <p>It was an easy table that was converted from a dictionary
        with the name of the repo as the key to an array, then cycled
        through and turned into a long string of HTML code that makes a
        total table for the return. This was stupid so I</p>
        <p><strong>Changed it.</strong></p>
        <p>First thing I did was make the initial “repoDict” an array.
        After that I had to redo how I was actually generating the
        formattedString to be appended to the element in the HTML. This
        meant first using a ForEach loop and an arrow function to grab
        the x.name, x.stargazers_count, and the x.size (which is
        actually in KB fun fact). I also got to figure out how to use
        formatted strings in JS which is super handy (you use `` as the
        string and ${var} to access specific vars within it).</p>
        <p>Next step was to sort the repos so the ones that I consider
        more important show up at the top of the table. First I sorted
        the array by the star count on the repo, and the secondary sort
        was then on the size of the repo (bigger usually means more work
        done on it). At some point I may have to add a scroll feature,
        but that can probably done strictly with CSS.</p>
        <p><strong>Other ideas</strong><br /></p>
        <p>- Demo of some specific programs?</p>
        <h3 id="devlog-page">Devlog Page</h3>
        <p>So technically this issue hasn’t happened yet, but I’m
        starting to think more about it. There is going to be an issue
        with how the blog posts are shown. Currently they are one one
        horizontal plane and I’m not sure if after this post if it will
        show on the next line or simply overflow. The first thing I’m
        going to do is probably be just making it fit in a box and then
        add scrolling function. I may also set a sort function with a
        dropdown such that you can sort based on chronological order.
        Other ideas to add to sorting include adding a star or other
        marker to mark a post as important or as a standard devlog (such
        as I would want to star the Word Hy-phen-ation devlog). This
        could be done with changing up the html template a little bit
        probably with adding a new variable and then when that dropdown
        is selected only displaying something
        <code>starred: true</code>.</p>
        <p>Other than having a scroll box of some kind, if it starts to
        get a lot more full because I maintain it regularly, I might end
        up adding a cool calendar feature, where a user can see the last
        5 devlogs, some listed important ones they might like, and then
        access to past devlogs in a cool thing where the days that have
        active devlogs appear on a calendar with a white circle. Will
        have to think more on this.</p>
        <p>Actual changes for devlog page will probably be on the next
        devlog (hopefully tomorrow).</p>
        <p>.</p>
